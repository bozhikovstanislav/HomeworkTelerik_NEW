.NET isn't just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications.
The knowledge of C# implies some knowledge of .NET
 (because the C# object model corresponds to the .NET 
 object model and you can do anything interesting in C# just by using .NET libraries).
  The opposite isn't necessarily true as you can use other languages to write .NET applications.

C# is a programming language,
 .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the.NET Framework (an application framework library)
  or 
  .NET is the framework that the language is built on.
